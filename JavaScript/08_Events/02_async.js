// Javascript async

//JavaScript:-  By default JavaScript is a synchronous language, having single thread. This means javaScript execute code line by line.

//Execution Context :- 
    // -> Execute code line by line. it means until js complete one operation it won't move forward to execute another operation.
    // In short, Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

// Blocking code VS non Blocking code
//      Block the flow of program -> read file sync
//      Doesn't block execution -> read file async

// both depends on usecase , when we would have require to block code execution and read file as if user registration we will use sync, and the time we need non blocking code we use async.
